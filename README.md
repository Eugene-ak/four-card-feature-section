## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - React framework
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learnt to use css grid to determine layouts of elements on website and how to position children within elements.

### Continued development

Css grid allows developers to build two-dimensional layouts unlike flexbox and this is a very helpful feature in css. It also avoids extra markup to serve as containers for elements. Moving forward, I think using grid is appropriate for planning and handling layouts.
